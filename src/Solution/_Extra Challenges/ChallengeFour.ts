// In this exercise, you're going to decompress a compressed string.

// Your input is a compressed string of the format number[string] and the decompressed output form should be the string written number times. For example:

// The input

// 3[abc]4[ab]c

// Would be output as

// abcabcabcababababc

// Other rules
// Number can have more than one digit. For example, 10[a] is allowed, and just means aaaaaaaaaa

// One repetition can occur inside another. For example, 2[3[a]b] decompresses into aaabaaab

// Characters allowed as input include digits, small English letters and brackets [ ].

// Digits are only to represent amount of repetitions.

// Letters are just letters.

// Brackets are only part of syntax of writing repeated substring.

// Input is always valid, so no need to check its validity.

// Learning objectives
// This question gives you the chance to practice with strings, recursion, algorithm, compilers, automata, and loops. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to work on coding with better efficiency.
